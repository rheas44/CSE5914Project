You don't necessarily have to deep-fry this one, though that is the most common method used in the South. I like it pan-fried just as well. It is a completely different dish. Cut the fillets into serving pieces of about 4 ounces each. Soak all the fish in the milk for 1 hour. Mix the flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper, and the crab and shrimp seasoning together. Drain the fish and dredge in the cornmeal mixture. Deep-fry in 375\u00f8 oil, a few pieces at a time, until golden brown. Keep pieces warm in a 200\u00f8 oven until all is complete, or pan-fry on both sides in a bit of oil or butter until the fish is lightly browned and done to your liking. Do not overcook catfish. Traditionally, deep-fried catfish was served with hushpuppies. I am convinced that you also need a great deal of very cold beer with this catfish fry.",

This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a separate course with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after it's cooked, as the cheese gets tough when reheated. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until they are soft. Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan, and cook them, covered, 8 minutes. Add the corn, heese, and salt to the chile mixture.

    "instructions": "* NOTE: Use 1 1/2 pounds or MORE of ripe mushrooms. The darker mushroom (older) adds a stronger flavor to the soup, that's what I usually use. I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec",

    "servings": "4 servings",
    "instructions": "In a large saute pan, heat one tablespoon of the corn oil. Add the onion, ginger and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat. Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric and the tomato and continue to cook until it turns dry. Remove from the heat and cool down. In a large mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, the cooled onion mixture, shrimp, chopped lime zest and juice, cilantro, chives, beaten egg and 3 tablespoons of the panko. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Mix well so that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Test a small quantity by forming a teaspoon of this mix into a small patty and frying it in a pan. Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary. Divide this mixture into 4 equal portions. Form into balls and flatten to form small patties. Put the rest of the panko on a cutting board. Place the patties one at a time in the bread crumbs. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet large enough to hold the crab cakes on medium heat. Add the oil and fry the crab cakes. When the cakes turn a light golden color, flip them over and cook them on the other side until they are light golden in color. Using a slotted spatula, remove and drain on a paper towel. Take 4 large plates and place the baby greens in the centers and a pappadum on top of the greens. Fill each pappadum with a scoop of Avocado Salad and top with a crab cake. Spoon the tamarind around the plate. This recipe yields 4 servings.",

My husband's grandmother used to make this stew during the harvest season. She and Grandpa lived on a small farm and all the veggies and herbs were grown on the farm. Grandma also made her own Italian sausage. Although I find this rendition a fair imitation, nothing can compare with Grandma's Stew (can't even remember the correct name for it).

    "servings": "6 Servings",
    "instructions": "\"In a number of cultures cooks stuff the small intestine of the cow, sheep or pig and boil, bake or roast it. In Tunisia, this is known as \"merguez\", in Eastern Europe as \"kishke\", in Indonesia, it is the spectacular \"usus\" in coconut milk. The \"soonday\" of Korea is entirely different. It originated in the cold climate of mountainous North Korea where the intestines of the wild mountain pigs were used. Now it's prepared all over the country and brought in large buckets to the public markets of Pusan, Kyongu, Seoul, Taegu and elsewhere. This sausage stuffing is made of rice, seasonings and beef or pork blood (or substitute 8 ounces canned tomato puree). 1. Clean the intestine as received from your butcher once again. Rinse well in cold water, then soak in lightly salted water for 1 hour; this makes the intestine firm and easier to handle. Tie up one end firmly with cotton string. 2. Prepare the stuffing. Mix the cooked rice, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, sesame seeds, scallions and either blook or tomato puree. Loosely stuff the intestine either by machine or by a funnel -- forcing the stuffing along the entire length. Do not fill too tightly since the intestine may split in cooking when the rice expands. Tie the open end firmly. The intestine may also be stuffed as individual sausages in which case it is cut into the desired lengths, tied, filled and tied again. 3. Place the soonday in a large pan, curling it around like a snail. Cover it with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Then turn to low and cook uncovered for 3/4 hour. At the end of this time, insert a skewer in the soonday to test for doneness. As when testing a cake, if the skewer is dry and the soonday is firm to pressure, it is done. Cut diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices and serve warm or at room temperature (warm is better). Serve on festive occasions especially after the harvest of rice, cabbage (or whatever is being grown) with your favorite Korean dip. Serves 6 to 8.",

While the chicken marinates (or 30 minutes before you are ready to bake) soak the bamboo skewers in water to keep them from burning in the oven. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Assemble skewers with a piece of chicken and half a fig. Stand skewers up in a casserole dish; spoon the marinade over the chicken and sprinkle with brown sugar. 3. Bake until the sugar topping turns into a golden brown crust and the chicken is white in color throughout, about 40-50 minutes. Serve while hot. Note: This upbeat chicken preparation gains its flavors from both the marinade and the brown sugar topping. Served in bite sized portions, this is a terrific sweet and savory item for parties.

    "servings": "8 Servings",
    "instructions": "* NOTE: Use 1 1/2 pounds or MORE of ripe mushrooms. The darker mushroom (older) adds a stronger flavor to the soup, that's what I usually use. I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec",

NOTES: * Soup with a mixture of vegetables -- I had an eclectic mixture of vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I collected them and came up with this soup. It was very good, so I would like to share it with you all. Caveat: I rarely measure anything, so be careful of quantities. * This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days.

Be careful not to rub your eyes or the corners of your mouth with your hands until you wash them well, because the pepper oil stings your eyes and mouths, too! Coating your hands with oil will make them slippery, so be extra careful when handling a knife or other kitchen utensils! NOTES : 4 servings",

Soften tortillas by putting them in the microwave for 25-45 seconds. Arrange tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil in a 2 x 4 arrangement (4 tortillas overlapping in one row, then the other four overlapping in a row below the first four -- picture the Olympic Rings for an idea of what I'm talking about!). Begin adding your fillings, first spreading the sour cream, salsa and beans along the center of your line of tortillas, next adding the avocados, cheese, and other ingredients. Then, use the foil to help you wrap the tortillas over the fillings to create a giant burrito. Wrap as tightly as possible, then seal the foil (you might have to use 2 sheets of foil) to hold the burrito shape. Secure with toothpicks. Refrigerate for 1 hour or more to mold the shape. When you are ready to serve, unwrap the burrito on a large cutting board, remoing the foil but leaving the toothpicks (the shape will hold very well). Just before serving, slice into 2\" wide slices. Serve with a little dipping bowl of salsa and sour cream. YUM!",

Combine the remaining 2 cups cream, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, and the vanilla bean in a large heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat. Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Be forewarned: the mixture will break. Don't be alarmed. Pour it into a glass bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely at room temperature. When cooled, remove the vanilla bean and pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip. Beat at medium-speed to combine the mixture. If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture. Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, the remaining sugar and the mashed banana. Mix thoroughly. Add the butter and mix well. Press the mixture into a 9\" pie pan. Bake until browned, about 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool, for about 10 minutes. To assemble, spread about 1/2 cup of the custard on the bottom of the crust. Arrange about a third of the banana slices, crowding them close together, over the custard. Next, spread 1 cup of the custard over the bananas. Arrange another third of the banana slices close together over the custard. Top with 1 cup of the custard and the banana slices. Top with the remaining custard, covering the bananas completely to prevent them from turning brown. After this pie is assembled it will come about 2-3\" above the pie tin; it is a very high pie. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. Cut the pie into wedges and serve with a drizzle of caramel and chocolate sauce. Top with the whipped cream and saved chocolate. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yields: One 9\" pie, 8-10 servings.",

Empanadas are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. \"The secret to making good dough,\" says Belita, \"is to massage it, not knead it.\" It may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb. For the dough: To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken, then strain and reserve the broth. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth; the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the chicken a little bite. Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve.",
