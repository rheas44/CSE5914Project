You don't necessarily have to deep-fry this one, though that is the most common method used in the South. I like it pan-fried just as well. It is a completely different dish. Cut the fillets into serving pieces of about 4 ounces each. Soak all the fish in the milk for 1 hour. Mix the flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper, and the crab and shrimp seasoning together. Drain the fish and dredge in the cornmeal mixture. Deep-fry in 375\u00f8 oil, a few pieces at a time, until golden brown. Keep pieces warm in a 200\u00f8 oven until all is complete, or pan-fry on both sides in a bit of oil or butter until the fish is lightly browned and done to your liking. Do not overcook catfish. Traditionally, deep-fried catfish was served with hushpuppies. I am convinced that you also need a great deal of very cold beer with this catfish fry.",

    "ingredients": "1 tb Peanut oil, 1 lb Low-fat extra-firm tofu OR firm drained and cut into 1-inch cubes, blotted dry, 2 md Garlic cloves minced, 1 sm Jalapeno OR other fresh chile stemmed seeded if desired, minced, 1 1/2 lb Red cabbage shredded as directed, 2 tb Rice wine vinegar, 2 tb Soy sauce, 2 tb Minced fresh cilantro leaves, 4 lg Whole-wheat tortillas (12-inch)",
    "servings": "4 servings",
    "instructions": "INTRO: Golden brown pieces of sauteed tofu are a good foil for a cabbage slaw with Asian seasonings. Serve any extra slaw on the side. For less heat, remove the seeds from the Chile before mincing. 1. Prepare the cabbage. Remove tough outer leaves; quarter. Trim: remove tough white stem/parts. Slice crosswise into very thin strips. 2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil until almost smoking in large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat. Add tofu and cook, turning pieces every minute or so, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer tofu to medium bowl. 3. Add garlic and jalapeno to empty skillet and stir-fry over high heat until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add cabbage and stir-fry until slightly wilted, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce, cover, and cook until cabbage is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro and remove pan from heat. Allow slaw to cool slightly. 4. Meanwhile, heat each tortilla until warm in clean skillet set over medium heat. Lay tortillas flat on work surface. Spread about 3/4 cup slaw down center of each and top with several pieces of tofu. Roll up, tucking sides toward center to form bundle. Slice each roll in half and serve immediately.

For a change, the chiles could be left whole, stuffed with corn and cheese, and cooked in cream. But this combination is delicious any way. This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a separate course with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after it's cooked, as the cheese gets tough when reheated. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning, until they are soft. Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan, and cook them, covered, 8 minutes. Add the corn, heese, and salt to the chile mixture. Cover tightly with foil or a lid and let it bake for 20 minutes for frozen corn. If you use fresh corn, cook for 40 minutes, adding the cheese after the first 20 minutes of cooking time. Serve the vegetables hot, with the sour cream.",

I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec",

    "instructions": "In a large saute pan, heat one tablespoon of the corn oil. Add the onion, ginger and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat. Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric and the tomato and continue to cook until it turns dry. Remove from the heat and cool down. In a large mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, the cooled onion mixture, shrimp, chopped lime zest and juice, cilantro, chives, beaten egg and 3 tablespoons of the panko. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Mix well so that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Test a small quantity by forming a teaspoon of this mix into a small patty and frying it in a pan. Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary. Divide this mixture into 4 equal portions. Form into balls and flatten to form small patties. Put the rest of the panko on a cutting board. Place the patties one at a time in the bread crumbs. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet large enough to hold the crab cakes on medium heat. Add the oil and fry the crab cakes. When the cakes turn a light golden color, flip them over and cook them on the other side until they are light golden in color. Using a slotted spatula, remove and drain on a paper towel. Take 4 large plates and place the baby greens in the centers and a pappadum on top of the greens. Fill each pappadum with a scoop of Avocado Salad and top with a crab cake. Spoon the tamarind around the plate. This recipe yields 4 servings.",

My husband's grandmother used to make this stew during the harvest season. She and Grandpa lived on a small farm and all the veggies and herbs were grown on the farm. Grandma also made her own Italian sausage. Although I find this rendition a fair imitation, nothing can compare with Grandma's Stew (can't even remember the correct name for it). Grandma DeMaio's stew was lovingly preparred on top of a wood burning stove! How we all loved it!

Add bell pepper and onion, and cook over medium heat, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, potatoes, garlic and 1/4 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until all vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in spinach, cilantro and red pepper flakes until spinach is wilted. Add feta and stir to blend. 3. Lightly spray an 8-in. square baking pan with vegetable oil. Warm each tortilla in a dry skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute per side. Place 1/3 cup of vegetable mixture in the lower part of each tortilla and roll up. Carefully place enchiladas seam side down in the baking pan, brush lightly with some of the liquid from the salsa, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. 4. To serve, divide lettuce among 6 plates. Place enchiladas on top of the lettuce. Top with salsa and garnish with cilantro sprigs. Notes: A nicely spiced entree, these light enchiladas are filled with veggies instead of the typical beef, pork or chicken. A bit of feta cheese is in the wrap for tangy flavor and creaminess. >from Kitpath with a little help from mcbuster 2.0d",

    "ingredients": "1 Yard small beef intestine, 2 c Rice, cooked but still firm, 2 Garlic cloves crushed, 1 sl Fresh ginger, 1\", crushed, 1 ts Salt, 1/2 ts Pepper black or white, 1 tb Korean sesame oil, 1 ts Sesame seeds crushed, 5 Scallions chopped, 2 c Beef or pork blood",
    "servings": "6 Servings",
    "instructions": "\"In a number of cultures cooks stuff the small intestine of the cow, sheep or pig and boil, bake or roast it. In Tunisia, this is known as \"merguez\", in Eastern Europe as \"kishke\", in Indonesia, it is the spectacular \"usus\" in coconut milk. The \"soonday\" of Korea is entirely different. It originated in the cold climate of mountainous North Korea where the intestines of the wild mountain pigs were used. Now it's prepared all over the country and brought in large buckets to the public markets of Pusan, Kyongu, Seoul, Taegu and elsewhere. This sausage stuffing is made of rice, seasonings and beef or pork blood (or substitute 8 ounces canned tomato puree). 1. Clean the intestine as received from your butcher once again. Rinse well in cold water, then soak in lightly salted water for 1 hour; this makes the intestine firm and easier to handle. Tie up one end firmly with cotton string. 2. Prepare the stuffing. Mix the cooked rice, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, sesame seeds, scallions and either blook or tomato puree. Loosely stuff the intestine either by machine or by a funnel -- forcing the stuffing along the entire length. Do not fill too tightly since the intestine may split in cooking when the rice expands. Tie the open end firmly. The intestine may also be stuffed as individual sausages in which case it is cut into the desired lengths, tied, filled and tied again. 3. Place the soonday in a large pan, curling it around like a snail. Cover it with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Then turn to low and cook uncovered for 3/4 hour. At the end of this time, insert a skewer in the soonday to test for doneness. As when testing a cake, if the skewer is dry and the soonday is firm to pressure, it is done. Cut diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices and serve warm or at room temperature (warm is better). Serve on festive occasions especially after the harvest of rice, cabbage (or whatever is being grown) with your favorite Korean dip. Serves 6 to 8.",

    "servings": "12 servings",
    "instructions": "1. Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken with the figs, wine, vinegar, oil, garlic, capers, oregano, chili pepper flakes, salt and bay leaves. Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes or marinate overnight in a ziptop bag. While the chicken marinates (or 30 minutes before you are ready to bake) soak the bamboo skewers in water to keep them from burning in the oven. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Assemble skewers with a piece of chicken and half a fig. Stand skewers up in a casserole dish; spoon the marinade over the chicken and sprinkle with brown sugar. 3. Bake until the sugar topping turns into a golden brown crust and the chicken is white in color throughout, about 40-50 minutes. Serve while hot. Note: This upbeat chicken preparation gains its flavors from both the marinade and the brown sugar topping. Served in bite sized portions, this is a terrific sweet and savory item for parties.

It was very good, so I would like to share it with you all. Caveat: I rarely measure anything, so be careful of quantities. * This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days.

Lightly oil a baking sheet and two 8x8 inch or 9x9 inch square cake pans. Place a steaming rack in a wok and add water to just below rack. Bring to a boil and have additional boiling water ready to replenish steamer. 3. Stir batter very well and pour enough into one of the cake pans to cover bottom, about 1/2 cup. Set pan on steaming rack, cover wok, and steam 5 minutes. Remove lid, being careful not to let condensed water drip on rice sheet. (A tea towel can be placed over pan before covering wok - K.F.) Remove cake pan; cool in a sink or lager pan filled with 1/2 inch cold water. Meanwhile, fill and steam the other cake pan. 4. Loosen the cooled rice sheet from the first pan and roll it out onto the oiled baking sheet. Turn over rice sheet to lightly oil both sides, then transfer to a platter. Repeat cooking, cooling, and oiling steps with remaining batter. 5. Stack rice sheets on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours before cutting into noodles or adding stuffings. ISBN 0-89721-098-0",

Try saut\u00e9ing about 1/2 cup of minced onions with 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in 1 cup of chopped tomatoes, 4-ounces of green chilies and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Simmer the mixture for about 15 minutes, then start adding 1/2 pound of cubed cheddar cheese to the mixture a few pieces at a time, melting and stirring as you go. Pour the prepared queso into a chafing dish or fondue pot to keep warm while serving with plain tortilla chips. You can add a little milk to the mixture if it's too thick. Dip the chips and enjoy.",

    "servings": "10 Servings",
    "instructions": "In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch and 1 cup of the heavy cream. Whisk to blend well. Set aside. Combine the remaining 2 cups cream, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, and the vanilla bean in a large heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat. Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Be forewarned: the mixture will break. Don't be alarmed. Pour it into a glass bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely at room temperature. When cooled, remove the vanilla bean and pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip. Beat at medium-speed to combine the mixture. If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture. Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, the remaining sugar and the mashed banana. Mix thoroughly. Add the butter and mix well. Press the mixture into a 9\" pie pan. Bake until browned, about 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool, for about 10 minutes. To assemble, spread about 1/2 cup of the custard on the bottom of the crust. Arrange about a third of the banana slices, crowding them close together, over the custard. Next, spread 1 cup of the custard over the bananas. Arrange another third of the banana slices close together over the custard. Top with 1 cup of the custard and the banana slices. Top with the remaining custard, covering the bananas completely to prevent them from turning brown. After this pie is assembled it will come about 2-3\" above the pie tin; it is a very high pie. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. Cut the pie into wedges and serve with a drizzle of caramel and chocolate sauce. Top with the whipped cream and saved chocolate. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yields: One 9\" pie, 8-10 servings.",

    "instructions": "Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled with chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil. Empanadas are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. \"The secret to making good dough,\" says Belita, \"is to massage it, not knead it.\" It may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb. For the dough: To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken, then strain and reserve the broth. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth; the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the chicken a little bite. Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve.",

Continue this process with all the cobs. Melt 8 oz. of butter in the skillet, and add all the contents of the bowl to the skillet - be sure to use a rubber spatula and get every last drop of that \"milk.\" There's a tremendous amount of flavor there. Add salt and LOTS of pepper. Over medium heat, cook, stirring often. The combination of the butter and natural \"milk\" from the cob, should make a creamy combination; if that doesn't happen, then you need some more butter. Add it, until the consistency is almost that of canned, creamed corn. Add a pinch of sugar and stir through. Taste, and add more s&p, if necessary. If the corn is good, and it's prepared properly, this is absolutely to die for.",

    "servings": "4 Servings",
    "instructions": "Start with the beef. Cook it with the onions, rub it with pepper, and when it is crispy on both sides, sprinkle salt over it. Add the water and the bay-leaves. Cover the pan with the lid, turn the heat very low, and let it simmer for at least 2 hours. Turn it now and then, sprinkle it, and add some water when it cooks dry. There has to be a lot of gravey (Dutch!) in it. We cook this on a stove (like everything), but I am sure it can be done in an oven as well. Peel the potatoes, and cut them in 4 parts. (remove the black spots + the sprouts as well). Remove the green and the stalks from the cauliflower, and make not too small \"roses\", as we call it. Don't chop it. Boil the potatoes in water + some salt. It needs about 20 minutes, before ready. When floury potatoes are used, don't add too much water, \u00b1 till they are half covered. Mind that they don't burn. When the water boils, turn the heat down, let it cook on low heat. Put the cauliflower in a pan and pour water, till everything is covered. Add some salt. Let it boil on low heat for about 20 minutes. Make the sauce this way: pour 3 tablespoons oil in a pan.(for example sunflower oil.) add 3 tablespoons flour and stir. Put it on the stove and cook it quickly. When this is well mixed and warm, add one cup water, stir again. add some salt. This sauce has to be nice creamy. It must be possible to pour it. Not too thin!! When the cauliflower is ready, pour off the water, put it on a plate and pour the sauce over it. Sprinkle the nutmeg on top of it. Eat the poatoes, cauliflower and meat together, but not mashed or mixed. Pour the gravey of the meat over the potatoes. NO MATTER WHAT I TOLD YOU: THIS IS GREAT!!! I CONSIDER TO COOK IT TOMORROW FOR DINNER. DELICIOUS!!",

In a medium saute pan, saute bell pepper, onion and jalapeno in olive oil over medium heat until soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add cream sauce and stir to blend. Pour mixture into the bowl of a blender; puree. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Stir in cheese and set aside. (Sauce may be made ahead. Cover and refrigerate until needed.) Heat an outdoor grill with wood chips. Brush each mushroom cap with chimichurri and season lightly with salt and pepper. Grill the caps on both sides until tender and browned. Remove from heat and reserve. Season scallops lightly with salt and pepper. Place cornhusks over wood chips. Lay scallops on an oiled hinged grill or place them on skewer. Cover the grill and smoke the scallops until firm, 4 to 6 minutes. To serve, spoon sauce onto four plates. Place 2 mushroom caps on each plate and add a smoked scallop to the cavity of each one. (If using pre-smoked purchased scallops, allow 3 or 4 per serving.) Arrange cilantro leaves around the caps and sprinkle each plate rim with parsley. William Rice, Chicago Tribune Magazine 2/22/98",

    "ingredients": "1 Fresh Duck, 4 1/2 pounds, 3 Or 4 Star Anise, 2 ts Sichuan peppercorns, 1 Two-inch cinnamon stick, 1 1/2 tb Coarse salt, 1 One-inch cube ginger, smashed, 1 Scallion, Dark soy sauce, 1 tb Dry sherry or Shaoxing wine, 1 tb Cornstarch, 1/2 ts Sugar, 1 Egg white, beaten until foamy, Oil for frying",
    "servings": "6 Servings",
    "instructions": "INSTRUCTIONS; Rinse the duck and dry thoroughly. Combine the star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon and salt in a skillet; heat, shaking the skillet, until the spices begin to smoke and the salt starts to turn a light golden color. Cool. Sprinkle some of this mixture into the cavity of the duck including all the star anise and the cinnamon stick. Add the ginger and scallion to the cavity and skewer closed. Rub the outside of the duck with the rest of the seasoned salt mixture and hang the duck by a string (around the neck if the duck has a head or under the wings if not) overnight in a cool, airy place. The next day, steam the duck on a plate in a large steamer or covered wok for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Cool and rub all over with a small amount of dark soy sauce. Wrap in foil and refrigerate until ready to cook. (It's fine this way for a day or two.) Several hours before cooking, take the duck out of the refrigerator and make a light batter: Mix the sherry with the cornstarch and sugar until well blended then stir in the egg white. Rub thoroughly over the duck and allow to sit. Heat a large quantity of oil until nearly smoking in a 16-inch or larger wok or in a large deep fryer. Immerse the duck in the oil and fry until golden, about 15 minutes, spooning the oil continuously over the exposed part of the duck. You might want to turn the duck during this time. If so, carefully remove it with a large slotted spatula or skimmer and drain the cavity into a bowl before adding it again to the hot oil. When the duck is done, drain it on paper towels. Let the duck rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then carve it Western- style or cut into pieces, Chinese-style. A suggestion is to serve it on a bed of watercress that has been sprinkled very lightly with sesame oil. The juices from the duck will blend with the sesame oil to make a sauce. TEA-SMOKED DUCK; Follow the steps above and steam the duck only 1 hour. Before refrigerating, line a large wok with aluminum foil and spread 1 cup of uncooked rice, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of Chinese black tea over the bottom. Put the duck on a metal rack suspended over the tea mixture; cover with the wok lid. Moisten paper towels and press them around the edge of the wok lid forming a seal. Turn the heat to medium high and allow the duck to smoke for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the duck sit for another 45 minutes. Uncover, wrap the duck and refrigerate. Then proceed as in the master recipe.",

    "servings": "1 Servings",
    "instructions": "*(use any combination of tur dhal, chana dal or even split yellow peas) Wash and rinse the dhals and rice thoroughly. When the rinse water runs clear, soak the dhals and rice together in a bowl with fresh water for a couple of hours. Drain the dhal-rice mixture and grind into a somewhat coarse mixture in a blender using water when necessary. Empty the batter into a bowl, add some salt and let it rest for at least an hour. You could also let it ferment overnight if you like a sourdough tang in your pancakes. To make the pancakes, heat a non-stick/well-seasoned cast iron skillet on a moderate stove. If a few drops of water bounce off the pan, the pan is hot enough and you can proceed to make the pancakes. Drop a ladleful of the pre-prepared batter in the center of the pan and with the back of the ladle, swirl the batter from inside to outside to form a thin round pancake. Wait till the top looks dry, wait another minute if you like them crisp and flip to cook the other side. Remove onto a plate and eat immediately with a nice coriander chutney. (Continue preparing pancakes in the same way, till you run out of batter and/or chutney. The batter will also keep in the fridge for almost a week and you can prepare the pancakes when the mood strikes you.) Variation: Can add finely chopped onions/jalapenos/spinach/ginger/a few cumin seeds, anything you fancy, to the batter before making the pancakes. You will however not be able to make neat circular pancakes. Instead, you will end up with (tasty) irregular shaped ones.",

Place the chicken in a pot that is just large enough to hold it and tall enough to completely cover it with water. Add ice water just to cover the chicken and stir briefly. Place in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Remove the bird and rinse for several minutes under cold running water to remove all salt inside and out. While the chicken is in the refrigerator, make a simple stock by simmering the neck, giblets (no liver), 1 onion quartered, 1 leaf end of celery, 2 sage leaves, 2 thyme sprigs, and 1 quart water in a large saucepan over low heat for 1 to 2 hours. Strain and save the stock. Pull the meat from neck and add to the stock. Cut up the giblets and add to the stock. Preheat the oven 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Arrange a V-rack for holding the bird over a pan to catch juices. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the stock into the pan, reserve the rest. Place the remaining onion, leaf ends of celery, sage leaves, and thyme sprigs, plus the orange and bay leaf, in the chicken cavity. In a small bowl, stir together corn syrup and butter. Brush the chicken lightly with this mixture and place in a V-rack, breast side down. Roast 20 minutes, basting with drippings in pan every 7 minutes. Remove the chicken from oven and turn so that one leg and thigh are up. Baste with the butter mixture and return to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven again, turn completely over so that the other leg is up, baste well with the butter mixture, and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven again and turn the oven down to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the oven door partially open so oven temperature will come down quickly. Turn the bird breast side up, brush well with butter mixture and return to the oven. Baste every 5 minutes. In 5 minutes, check breast meat temperature using an instant-read thermometer. The ideal temperature to remove it is 150 degrees to 154 degrees Fahrenheit. If necessary, place back in oven an additional 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches this temperature. Breast meat temperature rises about 2 degrees Fahrenheit every minute in the oven at this temperature. Add as much of the pan drippings to the remaining stock as you can without getting the sauce too salty. Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water and stir it into the stock-drippings mixture in a large saucepan. Heat over medium meat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Allow chicken to stand at least 15 minutes after removing from the oven. Carve or partially carve the chicken and arrange back in bird form on the serving platter. Pass hot gravy in a separate bowl.

Add sour cream and continue heat for 10 or so minutes more or until the mix is warm. Serve with good bread and greens... Ingredients for this excellent vegetarian chile are variable, depending on what is available, what crops are season, and how hot the cook decides to make the dish. The recipe uses canned corn, beans, and tomatoes, but fresh produce is all ways preferred when available. Of course dry beans need a good water soak before being used to prepare the chile. We've tried several hot sauces, and most are good, but I just prefer the Cajun Sunshine, or if fresh chiles are avalable, use them. The amount of 'hot ingredient' is of course to be determined by the cook.",

    "instructions": "Traditional New Year's good luck dish of the American Southern States has 4 ounces of sliced bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2 wide pieces. (1/4\" dice if using slab bacon with its rind removed). Brown, crisp, drain on paper toweling. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat and use it to saute onion etc. McNair's touch: white rice cooked in broth; diced red and/or green peppers. The crisp bacon would be crumbled and used as a garnish. *Degrees of doneness: Cooked Black-eyed peas, canned or homemade, may be used in place of frozen: but canned tend to be fully cooked and too soft. The beans should be done yet crunchy (about 20 to 30 minutes shy of tender). Frozen peas are ideal for this recipe. They require an additional 20-30 minutes cooking (check package). TIP: Dried BEP's double their volume when cooked. In a heavy saucepan over medium-high, add oil and onion. Stir to coat onion. When hot enough to saute, add celery and bell peppers. Saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 mins. Add cooking spray or a little water if necessary to prevent browning. Stir in the peas, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, and just enough water (broth) to cover barely. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, partially covered, until the peas are tender but still hold their shape, 15 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the rice (white or brown) in broth. TIP: Brown rice may be cooked in water with a piece of lemon peel (dime-sized). Stir tomato concasser into peas and simmer uncovered, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, season to taste with salt and generous amount of ground pepper and hot sauce, and heat through, about 2 minutes. Stir in most o the green onion and chopped parsley. Transfer to a serving dish, garnish with parsley sprigs and serve hot.

FLAXSEEDS - tiny oval-shaped brown seeds, also called linseeds. Bland in flavor, they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. Available from natural food stores. Notes: Fresh orange juice, sweet maple syrup and toasted poppy seeds add loads of flavor to these muffins. Be sure the poppy seeds are fresh because old ones can be bitter. The trick to making great muffins is not to overwork the batter, which results in a dense, heavy texture. Flaxseed makes eggless baked goods moist; serves as a binding agent.",

    "servings": "1 Servings",
    "instructions": "Although Thai curry paste can be purchased in oriental food specialty markets (and it is very good), it is usually preserved in a vegetable oil base, often tropical oils. Here's a recipe for both Red and Green curry paste I got in Bangkok this March: RED CURRY PASTE: combine first 7 ingredients in blender at medium speed until coarse ground. In mortar combine chili, salt and blended spices and grind to paste with pestle. Add water and grind till well mixed. Authentic traditional Thai red chili is prepared by cutting open 6 dried chilis and removing the seeds. Soak the pods in water for 30 minutes, drain and squeeze out the excess water. 2 tblspn chili powder can be substituted for fresh chilis. The Tuong Ot Sriracha chili sauce mentioned in a previous missive will also work well. GREEN CURRY PASTE: Prepare as above but substitute fresh green serrano chilis for the red chilis, fresh makrood for the dried, fresh laos root for the dried. Makrood leaves and rind: small double leaves - figure 8 shaped with lime-like fragrance, have a sour, strong pungent taste, are also used in soups and thinly sliced in salads. Laos root (kah) is very strong & sharp with penetrating odor, not unlike eucalyptus. kwvegan vegan",

Grind as fine as possible. Using a spatula, transfer the paste to a jar and pour in the last tablespoon of oil. Cap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Keeps 2 months in the refrigerator. Makes approximately 8 ounces. NOTES: Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been made, this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use it in Thai curries unless otherwise specified. A little added to stir-fry dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or grilling will add a real Thai accent. A teaspoon added to a meatloaf mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is rather exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk, it makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays. Use whole spices whenever possible. Anchovy fillets may be substituted for the anchovy paste. Shallots are preferable to onions; if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.

Pou into a buttered and floured tin [ about 22 CM] and bake in a preheated 190 degree C oven for about 1 hour or until cake is golden and just firm to the touch. Leave in the tin until quite cold. Serve with whipped cream. I like to either simmer orange rind shreds in a sugar syrup and serve a small pile of those beside the cake and decorate with candied peel, together with a few orange segments marinated in a little syrup and sometimes with a good dash of Grand Marnier. Pass the cream separately. NOTES : Based on a Spanish recipe, this dessert cake is very easily made. It can be made for Passover, but if so, the baking powder must be omitted and the eggs seperated. The whites are whipped stifly and folded in after the other ingredients are mixed.",

When using a nonstick skillet to stir-fry, you need only a tiny amount of oil. For dessert, cheese and pears round out the four food groups in this meal. Gingersnap cookies are a good choice since they satisfy a sweet craving but are lower in fat than most types of cookie. Sweet and spicy shrimp make an easy, impressive dinner. If you prefer, you can use wide noodles. Cut onion in half lengthwise; slice lengthwise into thin strips. Cut snow peas in half diagonally; set aside. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 7 minutes or until tender but firm; drain. Meanwhile, in nonstick wok or large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; cook onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add shrimp and snow peas; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. In bowl, whisk together stock, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch and hot pepper sauce; stir into shrimp mixture. Increase heat to high; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until shrimp are firm and pink and sauce is thickened. Toss noodles with shrimp mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts.

It was during World War II and she made this dish often. I liked it, so l thought she was cooking this just to be nice to us. Now I realize that it is a great way to feed 4 people on 1/2 pound of hamburger. I don't make the dish often anymore but I still think about it now and then. This dish will not win any cooking contests but it will tickle your children . . . and perhaps give them some good memories. Heat a 2-quart Dutch oven and add the oil, hamburger, and onions. Saut\u0082 until the meat browns and falls apart and the onions are clear. Remove excess fat from pan and add the green pepper and chili powder. Saut\u0082 an additional 5 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Mom used to serve this with canned corn and white bread. I know you can do better than that.",

    "instructions": "*NOTE: I used 4 Tbsp nonfat vegetarian chicken broth that I get at Whole Foods in the bulk bins. It has the best flavor of any I have ever tasted. You could use a combination of liquid canned broth and powdered broth to give the canned broth more flavor. **NOTE: I sliced the chicken breast halves into 1/2\" wide slices and then diagonally cut the slices to a little larger then bite size (do it how you prefer it) Cook over med-high heat in nonstick skillet the prepared chicken strips in the canola oil. Add the shallot and garlic and cook till the chicken doesn't look pink. Be careful to not overcook the chicken or it will become tough. It took about 8 - 10 minutes for me to accomplish this part. Put the frozen corn kernels and orzo into the soup pot. Rinse the quinoa very, very well in a strainer under continuous running cool water. When the draining water runs clear then drain the quinoa and add it to the pot. Add the vegetarian chicken broth (or nonfat chicken broth), water, bay leaves and seasonings to the pot. Bring to a boil and then lower to a moderate simmer. Cook for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if desired. We thought this tasted wonderful. It was nice and thick and wonderful for a winter meal.",

It is pretty basic American chili, but you can soup it up with cayenne, Tabasco, more chili powder, or anything else you can think of. Brown the beef in the oil, along with the onion, garlic, and chili powder. When the meat is brown and the onion clear, drain the fat and add remaining ingredients, including the beans. Simmer for at least 1-1/2 hours or until all is flavorful and the beans are very tender. This is better the second day. NOTE: My mother is convinced that cooking the chili powder with the meat is much better than simply putting the chili powder into the total mixture. I am convinced as well!

NOTES : This is a favorite dish in my family, where eggplant is eaten in some form almost every day. The eggplant in this dish tends to be a bit \"crunchy.\" If you wish to have a softer feel (as in Chinese dishes) then simmer for a little longer - 5min max! Also, for fire-lovers, you can double the chili content without upsetting the flavor of this dish. (Just make sure you serve it with lots of rice and iced water!)",

I crumbled the cake and mixed it with the mousse and put them in individual containers.] E. David writes: Nearly everyone knows and appreciates the old and reliable formula for a chocolate mousse-4 yolks beaten into 4 oz. of melted bitter chocolate, and the 4 whipped whites folded in. Here is a slightly different version, its faint orange flavor giving it originality. Break 4 oz of good quality bitter chocolate into squares and put in a fireproof dish in a low oven. When the chocolate is soft, after a few minutes, take it from the oven, stir in 4 well-beaten yolks, then 1 oz. of softened butter, then the juice of 1 orange. Use a Seville orange when in season; its aromatic flavor comes through better than that of the sweet orange. Beat the 4 egg whites as for a souffle and fold them into the chocolate mixture. Pour into little pots, glasses, or coffee-cups. This quantity will fill 6. Put in the refrigerator or a cool larder until ready to serve. Should you have some orange liqueur such as Grand Marnier or Curaao, add a spoonful in place of the same amount of orange juice.",

Measure 2 tablespoons sugar into a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons boiling water. Add a cinnamon stick and 1/4 pint cold water. Scrub the oranges, flute the peel lightly with a citrus zester and slice the fruit thinly, discarding the ends. Remove pips (seeds), put the orange slices into the sweetened water and leave to soak overnight. Next day, turn the oranges and their liquid into a saucepan. Cover and cook very gently for about 30 minutes. Carefully turn the slices once they cook. Lift the cooked orange slices from the pan one at a time, shaking to let the syrup drip back into the pan, and put them on a rack to drain and become cold. Remove the cinnamon stick, then boil the syrup until reduced to a few sticky spoonfuls. Cool slightly then stir in the 1 tablespoon honey. Assemble the tart just before serving. First sprinkle the ground almonds over the base of the cold pastry shell. Sweeten and flavour the soft cheese by stirring into it 1 teaspoon or so of honey and a little each of ground cinnamon and allspice. Whip the cream, fold in the sweetened and flavoured cheese, then spoon this mixture into the pastry shell. Arrange the orange slices on top, overlapping them slightly in decorative circles, and glaze with the gently re-warmed syrup.",

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; line cookie sheets with parchment paper and grease the parchment. Divide the dough into fourths. On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough, one piece at a time, into a 9-inch circle. In a small bowl or cup, combine 2 tablespoons honey and lemon juice; mix well. Brush the dough with some of the honey mixture; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over the entire surface. In another small bowl, combine the almonds, dried cherries and the remaining 3 tablespoons honey; mix well. Spread 1/4 the almond mixture onto the circle of dough, stopping 1/2-inch from the outer edge. Cut the circle into eight wedges. Starting at the wide outer edge, roll up each triangle jelly roll style, toward the tip. Gently bend both ends to form a crescent. Place on prepared cookie sheet; refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer. Repeat with the remaining dough, honey-lemon mixture, cinnamon and filling. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the pan and cool on wire racks. Unbaked crescents may be stored in a freezer-safe container or bags and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw before baking. Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).",

    "servings": "4 servings",
    "instructions": "To skin the nuts put into boiling water for about 1 minute then pull away the skins. Vanilla Sugar: Place 1 or 2 vanilla pods into jars of caster and icing sugar. The pods give a true vanilla flavour to the sugar. Spoon out the ammount required then fill up with more sugar. Put the marshmallows into a basin. Strain the pineapple, measure out up to 150ml (1/4 pint) of juice, add to marshmallows. Stand over a saucepan of hot, but not boiling water and leave until just dissolved. This can be done on the defrost setting in a microwave. Allow the mixture to cool. Finely chop the pineapple rings, add to the marshmallows with the nuts and sugar. Whip the cream until it stands in soft peaks, do not over-whip. Fold into other ingredients. Either spoon into the ice cream and freeze or put into a dish and place it in the freezer. Variation: Other fruits and nuts can be used. The marshmallows can be dissolved in vermouth instead of fruit juice. Rasberry Ice Cream: Dissolve the marshmallows in 225ml (71/2fl oz) of fresh rasberry pur\u0082e, add the sugar and cream as above. Other soft fruits can be used in the same way.

    "servings": "4",
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven.\n\nMake the lemon caper butter:\nPlace the butter, capers, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Mash with a fork to combine.\n\nPrepare the asparagus:\nArrange the asparagus on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzled with the olive oil, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper, and toss to coat. Spread out in a single layer around the perimeter of the baking sheet, making room for the salmon in the center.\n\nPrepare the salmon:\nSeason the salmon filets all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Place skin-side down (if you bought them with the skin on), spaced evenly apart, in the middle of the baking sheet, pushing the asparagus to the side if needed. \n\nDivide the lemon-caper butter among the filets, doing your best to spread it evenly. Don\u2019t worry too much since the butter will melt in the oven.\n\nRoast:\nRoast until the asparagus is crisp-tender and the salmon is just cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the salmon registers 120\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F for medium-rare, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nDrizzle with lemon juice and serve:\nDrizzle lemon juice over the salmon and asparagus and garnish with a few more grinds of pepper before serving.",
