Then put the beef tin on the hob and pour a glass of red wine into it. De-glaze by scraping up the sediment in the tin into the wine. Add the beef stock and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer. Add a sprig of thyme, This is now your sauce - the flavour will develop as it simmers down. Make incisions in the fillet with the tip of a knife and insert tiny sprigs of thyme. Rub all over with the oil. Sear the fillet on a pre-heated griddle or cast pan until sealed and then roast in the hot oven for 12 minutes or so (longer if you like it medium to well) and then rest in a warm place for a further 10 minutes to relax the muscle and to settle the juices. Whilst beef is cooking, heat the butter and oil in a wide based pan, add the honey and then add the carrots and beetroot, shaking in the buttery honey to coat them. Season. Tip the whole lot into a baking dish and roast in the oven until golden brown and tender (about 10 minutes but it does depend on how big the pieces are) Serve the fillet cut into thick slices on a dollop of the mash with the beetroots and carrots round. Strain the sauce into a clean pan, pressing through all the meaty juices, and whisk in a little of the chilled butter to give it body and a bit of a gloss. Serve with the beef. 1/2 Fat; 0 Other Carbohydrates",
